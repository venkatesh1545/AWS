## What is Cloud Storage?
In Cloud Computing, Cloud storage is a virtual locker where we can remotely stash any data. When we upload a file to a cloud-based server like Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud that file gets copied over the Internet into a data server that is cloud-based actual physical space where companies store files on multiple hard drives. Most companies have hundreds of the ese servers known as ‘server farms’ spanning across multiple locations. So, if our data gets somehow lost we will not lose our data because it will be backed up by another location. This is known as redundancy which keeps our data safe from being lost.

##  Features of Cloud Storage System:
### The key features of cloud computing are as follows.

- It has a greater availability of resources.
- Easy maintenance is one of the key benefits of using Cloud computing.
- Cloud computing has a Large Network Access.
- It has an automatic system.
- Security is one of the major components and using cloud computing you can secure all over the networks.

## Storage Systems in the Cloud
### There are 3 types of storage systems in the Cloud as follows.
    1. Block-Based Storage System
    2. File-Based Storage System
    3. Object-Based Storage System

1. **Block-Based Storage System:**
    - Hard drives are block-based storage systems. Your operating system like Windows or Linux actually sees a hard disk drive. So, it sees a drive on which you can create a volume, and then you can partition that volume and format them.
    - For example, If a system has 1000 GB of volume, then we can partition it into 800 GB and 200 GB for local C and local D drives respectively.
    - Remember with a block-based storage system, your computer would see a drive, and then you can create volumes and partitions.
2. **File-Based Storage System:**
    - In this, you are actually connecting through a Network Interface Card (NIC). You are going over a network, and then you can access the network-attached storage server (NAS). NAS devices are file-based storage systems.
    - This storage server is another computing device that has another disk in it. It is already created a file system so that it’s already formatted its partitions, and it will share its file systems over the network. Here, you can actually map the drive to its network location.
    - In this, like the previous one, there is no need to partition and format the volume by the user. It’s already done in file-based storage systems. So, the operating system sees a file system that is mapped to a local drive letter.
3. **Object-Based Storage System:**
    - In this, a user uploads objects using a web browser and uploads an object to a container i.e., Object Storage Container. This uses the HTTP Protocols with the rest of the APIs (for example: GET, PUT, POST, SELECT, DELETE).
    - For example, when you connect to any website, you need to download some images, text, or anything that the website contains. For that, it is a code HTTP GET request. If you want to review any product then you can use PUT and POST requests.
    - Also, there is no hierarchy of objects in the container. Every file is on the same level in an Object-Based storage system.
